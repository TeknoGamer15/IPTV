# IPTV based on YouTube Live Channels
M3U playlists of YouTube live channels. Add them to any IPTV client. Steps on how to add them are available at my [notes](https://abskmj.github.io/notes/posts/projects/youtube-live-channels/).

## Channels
Open an [issue](https://github.com/abskmj/iptv-youtube-live/issues/new) on this repository with the YouTube link to add a new channel/video or report a broken one.

## Quick Note
Although I have taken great care to keep the service stable, please note that the service is hosted on a basic tier of a cloud provider to minimize the cost. It might not have sufficient resources to handle numerous requests at a time. If you need a stable service, I would suggest you deploy this service with your cloud provider. An executable of this service is available for [download](https://abskmj.github.io/notes/posts/projects/youtube-hls-server/).
